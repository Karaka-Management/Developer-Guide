# Introduction

This developer guides intention is to provide useful information for developers to help you to understand the structure of the application, important API functions, workflows and standards for code quality as well as code style. The intention is to provide enough information to get a basic understanding of these key elements for module developers, frontend developers or developers working on the core application.

The guide is **not** explaining in detail how to use all of the API, for this you can find the automatically generated code documentation or even better use the test cases. All the provided information are very important to ensure the quality of the published code and often are mandatory. Not following these guides can cause security issues, worsen the user experience or even cause malfunction as well as make it difficult for other developers to understand the code.
