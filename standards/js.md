# Js

The js code needs to be ECMAScript2021 compliant. No js ECMAScript2021 deprecated or removed elements, functions or practices are allowed. Please use the `.eslintrc` configuration for Eslint to identify most of the basic code standards.

## Browser support

Js solutions must be valid on the newest versions of Edge, Firefox, Chrome and Safari.

## Variable scope

Variables should be defined with the scope in mind. `const` and `let` are the preferred definitions.

## Deprecated functions and variables

* `eval`

## Array

Arrays should always bet initialized by using `[]`.

```js
arr = [1, 2, 3];
```
