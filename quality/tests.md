# Tests

The applications goal is to achive 90% code coverage, which applies for the core application as well as all modules. All unit tests are located in the corresponding `tests` directory.

## PHPUnit

This application uses PHPUnit as unit testing framework. The PHPUnit directory is structured the same way as the `Framework`, `Modules`, `Install` and `Models` directories. Unit tests for specific classes need to be named in the same manner as the testing class.

In order to run all tests and also creating the dummy data for UI tests, execute the following command:

```sh
php phpunit.phar -c tests/PHPUnit/phpunit_no_coverage.xml
```

In order to also create a code coverage report run:

```sh
php phpunit.phar -c tests/PHPUnit/phpunit_default.xml
```

### Modules

Every module needs to have a `Admin` directory containing a class called `AdminTest.php` which is used for testing the installation, activation, deactivation, uninstall and remove of the module. Tests that install, update, remove etc. a module need to have a group called `admin`. After running the `AdminTest.php` test the final state of the module should be installed and active, only this way it's possible to further test the controller and models. A code coverage of at least 80% is mandatory for every module for integration.

## Jasmine

The javascript testing is done with jasmine. The javascript testing directory is structured the same way as the `Framework`. Unit tests for specific classes need to be named in the same manner as the testing class.
