# Configuration

## IDE

### PHPStorm

For uniform code formatting and guidelines import the PHPStorm configuration located in the `Build` repository. The configuration includes the code formatting standards as well as code inspection standards used for PHP, JavaScript, CSS and HTML. Due to the limitations of the IDE not all guidelines can be implemented but provide a good start for further inspections.
