# Requests

Requests can be either incoming requests such as http requests on the server side or outgoing requests such as ajax requests on the client side. At the same time it's also possible to generate outgoing requests on the server side for microservices as well as REST requests to third party APIs.

## Http Requests

A http request in its' most basic form only consists of a uri.

```php
$request = new Request(new Http('http://your_request.com/url?to=call'));
```

## Rest Requests

With the rest implementation it's possible to make http requests and read the response.

```php
$request = new Request(new Http('http://your_request.com/url?to=call'));
$result  = Rest::request($request);
```

Alternatively it's also possible to make a rest request directly from the Http request object.

```php
$request = new Request(new Http('http://your_request.com/url?to=call'));
$result  = $request->rest();
```

The result contains the raw response text. By defining the request method it's also possible to make other requests such as `PUT` requests.

```php
$request = new Request(new Http('http://your_request.com/url?to=call'));
$request->setMethod(RequestMethod::PUT);
$result = Rest::request($request);
```
